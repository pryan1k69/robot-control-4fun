# robot_control_BT
# This is my first mobile application written in Kivy Python

## So, this application is created for robots that you program yourself, for example in Arduino.

### It is connected to the microcontroller using the HC-05 Bluetooth module. You can change the code by adding another name, or in the Bluetooth settings in the phone, change the name of the device to HC-05.
### When the button is pressed, the application sends a signal to the Bluetooth module.

## A certain number is sent as a signal:
### 1 -- Forward button;
### 2 -- Back button;
### 3 -- Stop button;
### 4 -- Left button;
### 5 -- Right button;
### 6 -- Line button (I used a robot that drove along a given black line, so I added this function)
